## Overview

This code provides an implementation of the research paper:

```
  "DeepRemaster: Temporal Source-Reference Attention Networks for Comprehensive Video Enhancement"
  Satoshi Iizuka and Edgar Simo-Serra
  ACM Transaction on Graphics (Proc. of SIGGRAPH ASIA 2019), 2019
```
We learn to semi-automatically remaster vintage videos with a deep convolutional network.
Our network is based on temporal convolutions with source-reference attention mechanisms
trained on videos with example-based deterioration simulation, which allows us to automatically
remove film noises, improve contrast and sharpness, and add color based on reference color frames created manually.
See our [project page](http://iizuka.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/projects/remastering/) for more detailed information.

## Dependencies
#### Python dependencies
- [PyTorch (0.4.1+)](https://pytorch.org/) [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/)
- [opencv (3.4.1+)](https://opencv.org/)
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
#### System dependency
- [FFmpeg (requires to be configured with --enable-libx264)](https://ffmpeg.org/)

For information on how to install PyTorch, please refer to the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/). FFmpeg should be installed with libx264 support, which can be installed in Anaconda by using <code>conda install x264 ffmpeg -c conda-forge</code>.

### Simple installation process
- Create a python virtual environment and install the python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Install FFmpeg
  ```
  brew install ffmpeg # for MacOS
  ```


## Usage

First, download the model by running the download script:

```
bash download_model.sh
```

Basic usage is:

```
python remaster.py --input <input_video> --reference_dir <directory_of_reference_images>
```

The input video will be automatically restored and colorized based on the reference color frames using the model. If you want to perform restoration only, use <code>--disable_colorization</code> option.

Other options:

- `--gpu`: Use GPU for the computation (**recommended**). Defaults to false.
- `--disable_colorization`: Disable colorization and only perform restoration with enhancement. Defaults to false.
- `--mindim`: Minimum edge dimension of the input video. Defaults to 320.

For example:

```
python remaster.py --input example/a-bomb_blast_effects_part.mp4 --reference_dir example/references --gpu
```

### Preparing Reference Images

To prepare reference color images for your own video, it is recommended to first extract reference frames from the video using a scene detection technique such as [pyscenedetect](https://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Afterwards, colorize them by leveraging image editing software or recent interactive colorization techniques such as the [Interactive Deep Colorization [Zhang et al. 2017]](https://github.com/junyanz/interactive-deep-colorization/).

### Notes

- This is developed on a Linux machine running Ubuntu 18.04 during late 2018.
- We recommend using GPU with 4GB+ memory for fast computation.
